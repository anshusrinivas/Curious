# Bluetooth Messenger
# Introduction
In recent years, the integration of wireless communication into embedded systems has significantly expanded the scope and capabilities of modern technology. One prominent wireless technology is Bluetooth, which offers a reliable and efficient means of data transmission over short distances.
This project involves developing a simple embedded system that utilizes a Bluetooth module for wireless communication. The goal is to create a basic yet functional prototype that demonstrates how Bluetooth can facilitate remote data exchange between devices. By integrating a Bluetooth module with a microcontroller, we can enable seamless and efficient communication over short distances, paving the way for various practical applications such as remote sensing, home automation, and wireless data transfer.

# Overview
This project involves creating a simple embedded system using an HC-05 Bluetooth module, a VSD Squadron Mini microcontroller, and a 16x2 LCD display. The system receives messages via the Bluetooth module and VSD Squadron Mini processes the incoming data and updates the LCD in real-time. This project serves as an educational tool for understanding the basics of wireless communication and embedded system design, highlighting the ease of integrating different components to achieve a functional and practical solution.
